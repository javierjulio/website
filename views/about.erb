<p>Hi, I'm Javier Julio, <a href="http://twitter.com/javierjulio">@javierjulio on Twitter</a>. I'm a full stack software engineer and founding team member at <a href="http://www.jackpocket.com/">Jackpocket</a> in Soho. I'm at my best when working closely with a designer to fine tune every interface detail. I love what I do. Don't be shy, say <a href="mailto:jjfutbol@gmail.com">hello</a>.</p>

<p>I'm proficient in Ruby, a beginner in Objective-C, Swift and Node.js, and have been learning Python. Client side I stick with SASS and CoffeeScript although I do write plain JavaScript. I'm comfortable with command line tools as I stay organized thanks to my <a href="http://github.com/javierjulio/laptop">laptop script</a> and my <a href="http://github.com/javierjulio/dotfiles">dotfiles</a>.</p>

<p>As a developer it's important to me to keep any project I work on up to date and well tested. I've learned the value of TDD and BDD as it helps me be aggressive about change. As I get familiar with a codebase I develop ideas on what code can be improved or removed. Having tests backs me up and allows me to make those improvements safely and quickly.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I'm an avid reader and use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read what I come across on <a href="http://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> (through <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a>) or <a href="http://twitter.com/javierjulio">Twitter</a>. And of course I share any <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=javierjulio%20instapaper&src=typd&f=realtime">great reads</a>. I love everything soccer. During the week I dance tango and milonga. Thanks to my mother, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook and bake</a> for my family and friends. Occasionally I play paintball. If all else fails you'll find me on the couch watching Netflix or playing games.</p>
