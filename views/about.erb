<p><img src="/images/javier.jpg" alt="Javier Julio" class="self-portrait" width="78" height="100" /> Hi, I'm Javier Julio, <a href="http://twitter.com/javierjulio">@javierjulio on Twitter</a>. I'm a software engineer and speaker living in Brooklyn, New York developing rich applications for the web at <a href="http://www.9mmedia.com/">9mmedia</a> in the trendy Soho neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>

<p>I'm a full stack developer with a focus on the front end where I stress the details of bringing rich interfaces to life. I love what I do. If my focus moves from one stack to another, on my free time I focus on the other. I've been working with Ruby and Rails lately and have been enjoying it immensely. I've dabbled a bit in Node.js but Ruby has been my priority server side. You can see my progression, notes, and other projects on <a href="http://github.com/javierjulio">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I'm an avid reader and use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read what I come across on <a href="http://www.feedly.com">Feedly</a> (through <a href="http://reederapp.com/ios/">Reeder</a>) or <a href="http://twitter.com/javierjulio">Twitter</a>. I love everything soccer. During the week I dance tango. Occasionally I play paintball. Thanks to my mother, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook</a>. When all else fails its hard to beat an easy night on the couch watching Netflix. Sometimes you can find me gaming on PlayStation and Steam as jjfutbol.</p>
