<p><img src="/images/javier.jpg" alt="Javier Julio" class="portait" width="78" height="100" /> Hi, I'm Javier Julio, <a href="http://twitter.com/javierjulio">@javierjulio on Twitter</a>. I'm a software developer and speaker living in Brooklyn, New York. I create rich applications for the web, mobile, and desktop environments at <a href="http://www.9mmedia.com/">9mmedia</a> in the trendy Soho neighborhood of Manhattan.</p>

<p>I'm a full stack developer with a focus on the front end where I stress the details of bringing rich interfaces to life. I love what I do. If my focus moves from one stack to another, on my free time I focus on the other. I've been working with Ruby and Rails for the past year and have been enjoying it immensely. I've dabbled a bit in Node.js but Ruby has been my priority server side. You can see my progession, notes, and other projects on <a href="http://github.com/javierjulio">my GitHub profile</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from programming, I'm an avid reader and use <a href="http://www.instapaper.com/">Instapaper</a> to read anything I come across using Google Reader, Twitter or Flipboard. Using Netflix I've discovered great movies and shows I wouldn't have given a chance. When that bores me most likely I'll be gaming. You can find me on <a href="http://us.playstation.com/publictrophy/index.htm?onlinename=jjfutbol">PlayStation 3</a> and <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/id/jjfutbol">Steam</a> as jjfutbol. Add me and lets play!</p>

<p>My futbol teams are Newcastle United and Valencia. The first is to long of a story. Maybe someday I'll write about it. The second is because my mother is from there. I stayed each summer in Valencia as a child and that's how I learned to speak Spanish fluently. And thanks to her, I love to <a href="/recipes">cook</a>. Its relaxing and a great way to clear the mind.</p>
