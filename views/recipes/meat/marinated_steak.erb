<p class="note">This is a family favorite for holidays. We buy about a 1 inch thick steak and slice it in thin, wide pieces.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Sirloin steak (although any steak will do)</li>
	<li>2-5 garlic cloves</li>
	<li>1 Lemon</li>
	<li>Olive oil</li>
	<li>Butter</li>
	<li>Oregano</li>
	<li>Pepper</li>
	<li>Salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Place the steak in a oval pan (only used for marinating, not cooking)</li>
	<li>Squeeze all the juice out of 1 lemon into a cup</li>
	<li>Chop 2-3 garlic cloves (the more the better)</li>
	<li>Add oregano, olive oil, black pepper and the chopped garlic in the cup</li>
	<li>Stir the marinate sauce well</li>
	<li>Pour the marinate sauce on one side of the steak, flip it, and pour again</li>
	<li>Put the steak in the refrigerator for at least 3 hours but no more than 24</li>
	<li>Before you plan to cook leave the steak out for an hour</li>
	<li>Once ready add a little salt to the steak</li>
	<li>Place a small piece of butter on the grill pan</li>
	<li>Cook each side of the steak for about 6 minutes at medium-high, maybe longer depending on the thickness of the meat</li>
</ol>
