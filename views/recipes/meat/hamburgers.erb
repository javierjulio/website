<p class="note">Once you have hamburger meat mixed with herbs like basil, garlic and spring onions, its hard to go back. Prepare the hamburgers in advance if you can but if not they taste great cooked as soon as you make it. These make excellent leftovers as they taste even better the next day.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Ground beef</li>

<h3>Directions</h3>

<ol>
	<li>Buy a 3 pound pack of 90% ground meat (should make about 8-10 large hamburgers)</li>
	<li>Wash and chop several large leaves of basil (or use dry basil)</li>
	<li>Wash and chop 2-3 spring onions</li>
	<li>Wash and chop a lot of italian parsley (or use dry parsley)</li>
