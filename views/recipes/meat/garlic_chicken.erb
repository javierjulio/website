<p class="note">Why the funny title you ask? It really just came about as a joke one night when I bouted that out at my mother knowing she made this for my little sister. We always enjoy a bit of personality and attitude and since then the title has stuck. Trust me, once you try this you would have cried foul yourself for missing out! Works great along any small side dish.</p>
